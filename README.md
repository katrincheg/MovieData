#### M Language 

One of the interesting features I was working with was a specific code for Grouping in M language which enable me to Combine genres together for further analysis.

```

= Table.Group(#"Sorted Rows1", {"Movie Title"}, 

                                            {{"Combined Genre", each Text.Combine([Concat Genre], " / "), type text},

                                            {"AllData", each _, 

                                                        type table [Movie Title=nullable text, Release Date=nullable date, Wikipedia URL=nullable text, Concat Genre=nullable text, Director=nullable text, Actor First=nullable text, Actor Second=nullable text, Actor Third=nullable text, Actor Fourth=nullable text, Actor Fifth=nullable text, #"Budget ($)"=nullable number, #"Box Office Revenue ($)"=nullable number]}

                                            }

```
